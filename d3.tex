\section{Introduction}




\subsection{Identification}

This is the requirements specification for the level 3 project by team W. The project is based on an internship management system for Software Engineering (SE) and Electronic and Software Engineering (ESE) students, studying in the School of Computing Science.

\subsection{Purpose and Description of Document}

This document establishes a complete description of the behavior of the internship management system to be developed by Team W. The document gives a clear overview of the all of the main functions that the school of computer science internship management system must possess. The first section clearly outlines the main functions of the system, in a extended problem description.  


The requirements specification goes on to spell out the full scope of the system to be developed. It does this by providing a detailed description of the systems actors ( -those who will be interacting with the system on a daily basis ) and providing a detailed domain model. ( -a conceptual model of the specific problem, describing the various entities and their attributes, roles, relationships and constraints ) . 

The documents goes on to includes a full set of use cases for the system, that describe the interactions the users will have with the software. 

The requirements specification continues with a list of non functional requirements of the system (requirements that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors) and  provides a short summary of the key aspects of the requirements specification document itself.

Finally the document concludes with a glossary, a list of scenarios used in the development and creation of the systems use cases, and a collection of client interview documentation. 


\subsection{Document Status and Schedule}

The creation of this document was aided by two previous professional software development course work deliverables, and a client interview with course lectures Rose English. This Document is still in draft stages.

\section{Extended Problem Definition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The School of Computing Science are looking for a unified system for 
collecting, reviewing, and publishing internship advertisements. There are 
some main features which the system must possess: 

Submission of internship advertisements;

Review, comment, and publication of the internship advertisements;

Viewing of internship advertisements;

Notification of successful internship applications.

The system does not have to support the actual application process, students
are to use the companies own channels for this.

Companies wishing to submit advertisements to the system are required to first
contact the course coordinator for access to the system. This ensures no fake
or spam advertisements can be submitted.

Only textual data can be submitted as part of an advertisement. There are no
strict guidelines for advertisement content so as a result, no automatic checks
on the content can be done by the system, only manually by the course
coordinator. The only possible check may be to ensure no duplicate entries
to the system, this is because companies with multiple vacancies for the same
job are only allowed a single advertisement which states the number of
available positions.

Each advertisement has to be reviewed and accepted by the course coordinator
prior to submission for students to view. As part of the review process, the
course coordinator can comment on the advertisement, either for another member
of staff to look at prior to submission or as part of feedback to be sent back
to the company. In the event of an application being rejected, the system is
not required to submit feedback to the company, this is to be done separately
by the course coordinator.

When an internship advertisement has been reviewed and published, students 
are to be notified somehow. This can be done either by mass email or via a 
notification presented to the user on login to the system.

The system is available for all Computing Science students to access and 
they are all free to apply for any internship available. The login process could
conveniently be linked with existing student accounts and thus be handled separately
to the system.

Students will have a status to allow the course coordinator to track progress
through the system. A student can either be accepted into an internship, pending
approval/response to an internship application, or yet to apply/no current 
application in progress.

\section{System Scope}

%Give an overview of the system here, in the context of the surrounding
%environment.  Use case diagrams can be used to illustrate the
%interactions between actors in the environment and the system.

%You should explain the assumptions you have made in defining the
%boundary of the system (i.e. what the system will and will not do).

%Describe any conflicts in requirements expressed by different
%stakeholders, how you resolved them and why.

The system, broadly speaking, is to allow companies to submit advertisments 
of internships to the school. Upon approval by the course coordinator the 
advertisments can be viewed by students, who then apply to any internships 
that suit them. The students with successful applications can then notify 
the coordinator, who can approve or deny the students internship based on 
course outlines. 

Let us look at each actors interaction with the system (LINK THESE TO UML
DIAGRAMS)\\
\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
The Company can log in and submit advertisments to the system. They may 
view their own advertisements, as well as the standardised template for 
advertisments.\\

The Course Coordinator has the most interaction. They may view, comment 
on (aka tag as SE-based), approve and remove advertisments. They can also 
view and change each SE students application status, as well as sending 
the student a notification of success.\\

The Student may view advertisments and log in. They can also (while logged 
in send a notification of successful application to an internship, whether 
it's a job in the system or externally sourced.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
\\
We must clarify the boundaries of the system. The system will not 
handle internship applications in any form, it will only display the 
job details. It will however allow the student to send a notification 
of successful application to the course coordinator. The system will 
not notify companies that a successful student application has been 
approved, it will only notify the student. The system will allow any 
student to view the advertisments, but only SE students may notify 
the course coordinator of application.

\subsection{System Actors}

The Company: this includes any organisation that wishes to submit 
advertisments to the system. Organisations such as Club21, which handle
many different companies and advertisments, still count as a single Company
with regards to the system.\\

The Course Coordinator: this refers to the designated staff member who's job
it is to manage SE internships. This is a single person role, but can be 
passed from one staff member to another in the event of illness etc.\\

The Student: this is broken into two sub categories, that of SE students and
everyone else. SE students have more rights in the system. Widely, the student
is anybody with a GUID that wishes to use the system.\\

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

Describe the non-functional requirements for the system here, giving a
rationale (traceable to your requirements gathering) for each.  You
will need to think about how to group/structure requirements in this
section.

\section{Summary}

Give a (very short) summary of the key aspects of the requirements
specification.

\appendix

Some suggested appendices are included below.

Appendices should be used to include information not completely
necessary to the understanding of the main document.

\section{Glossary}

Definitions.

\section{Scenarios}

A collection of scenarios you developed to exercise and refine your
use cases.

\section{Stakeholder Interview Documentation}

Any evidence you gathered from stakeholders relevant to your
requirements description.  You don't need to include everything
verbatim here, but summary documents, for example, identifying the key
points you identified (particularly if they relate to requirements
conflicts) can be useful.
